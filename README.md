# USDA ERS Education Indicators
(Last updated: February 5th, 2020)

## Summary

Socioeconomic indicators like poverty rates, population change, unemployment rates, and education levels vary geographically across U.S. States and counties. ERS compiles the latest data on these measures and provides maps and data display/download for States and counties.

The education indicators is a set of measures of the share of adults 'Completing College', 'Completing Some College', 'Completing High School Only', and 'Not Completing High School' in 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and a five year average from 2014-2018. For 1970 and 1980, the share of adults who are college graduates includes those who completed at four or more years of college regardless of degree earned. In 1990, 2000, and 2014-2018 the share includes those who received a bachelor's or higher degree.

This data can be found [here](https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17829) and was last updated February 5th, 2020.

Gathering the county-level datasets for the education level datasets is repetitious because they are separated into 208 individual datasets parsed by state and measure. Therefore, a program was created to gather and compile these datasets.

Subsequently, a linear regression was built to predict the measures for 2030 and 2040 in every county in the United States. These predictions, as well as the data gathered from ERS, can be observed in the animations below and interactive plots can be found [here]()
